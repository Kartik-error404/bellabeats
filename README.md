# Bellabeat Google Project

This project analyzes smart device usage data from Bellabeat’s Fitbit dataset to gain insights into users' daily habits and health trends. The goal is to provide high-level recommendations to help guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

## 📁 Dataset

The data used in this analysis is from the **Fitabase Dataset** made publicly available by Bellabeat:
- Date Range: `03/12/2016` to `04/11/2016`
- Collected from 30 Fitbit users

**Key files:**
- `dailyActivity_merged.csv`
- `sleepDay_merged.csv`
- `hourlyCalories_merged.csv`
- `minuteStepsNarrow_merged.csv`
- `weightLogInfo_merged.csv`
- ... and others

## 📊 Objective

Analyze usage patterns such as:
- Daily activity trends (steps, calories)
- Sleep quality and its correlation with activity
- Heart rate and intensity levels
- User engagement with smart fitness tracking

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python / R (depending on analysis)
- pandas / ggplot2 / seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / R Notebook
- VS Code / Google Colab
- GitHub for version control

## 📈 Results

Key insights discovered:
- Users with higher activity levels tend to sleep more consistently.
- Calorie burn correlates well with step count and logged intensities.
- Very few users regularly log their weight or sleep data.

(You can expand this section with charts or bullet summaries from your final notebook.)

## 🧠 Recommendations

Based on the analysis:
- Encourage users to log weight and sleep for better tracking.
- Provide reminders or insights to motivate daily activity.
- Market features like intensity tracking to high-engagement users.
